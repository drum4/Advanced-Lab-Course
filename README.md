# Advanced-Lab-Course

This repository contains the data-analysis work and the evaluation of the experiments in Python
for the mandatory physics lab course for physics students ([FP](https://www.physi.uni-heidelberg.de/Einrichtungen/FP/))
i attended at Heidelberg University during the year 2018.

All the code was written by my lab partner ([@TimoKleinbek](https://github.com/TimoKleinbek))
or by myself ([@drum4](https://github.com/drum4)).

Most of the comments, titles and informations are in german language, because the course was held in german.

It covered the following experiments:

- ### Electromagnetism:
  - E01 Grundpraktikum Elektronik (basic internship electronics)
- ### Measurement Methods:
  - F80 Szintillatoren (scintillators)
